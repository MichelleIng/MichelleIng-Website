        <p class="lead mb-4">Although I don’t have much job experience, I would say I’m qualified when it comes to the basics of being in a work environment. Because of my previous experience working in the fast-food industry, I demonstrate good communication skills. When working the cashier register, I had to bag a lot of food to provide for the customers. I also stocked up on a lot of inventory, keeping track of what was running out and running errands for my managers. I received and managed a lot of money, demonstrating basics in both math and reading skills. As a cashier, I also had to work with people quite frequently and have to talk my way into situations that were especially chaotic. For example, some customers would be very rude, and I would figure out ways to still be as respectful to the customer as possible. With all the volunteering I’ve done, and being used to working early hour shifts, I’ve exemplified good time management skills as well. Having to fit a job, managing volunteering hours, while having a high school schedule was really difficult, however, I managed to juggle all of it while still maintaining good academics. In high school, I was also in a dance team as well. I competed in many dance competitions and won some medals, going on to compete in big places such as Disney and universal studios. I’m currently in a club at UC riverside known as the Vietnamese Student Association, which is a culture club. This club has given me many social skills by having many connections and giving an opportunity to improve and demonstrate my communication skills.  
<br><br>

        While also being able to maintain time management skills I also am able to work with both children and animals. Being that I volunteered in two different places that dealt with those two fields. The first was at an animal shelter where I learned to bottle feed kittens and cleaned many of their kennels. I also worked with someone in the medical field while volunteering here, by helping the vet clean their surgical tools and also shadowing certain vets. I had the opportunity to work with many sick cats as well, which was a new experience for me. While doing so, I also worked with many other volunteers as well. However, being the only high school volunteer, and surrounded in an environment of adult volunteers, I learned a lot of professionalism as I did have to communicate with them on many tasks I did. Some volunteers were there a lot longer than I was which made it a lot more common for me to ask more questions while I was still training. I also volunteered in a foster care center called Homes of Hope. I would read to many of the children, while also doing fun activities with them such as doing arts and crafts or building things. We also took care of them and made sure they were fed with snacks while also trying to make sure they were on top of their schoolwork as well. This volunteer experience has led me to be able to work with children as this program was an attempt to keep their spirits up. Being in the foster care system is never easy, especially for children that young of an age, and I’m happy I had the opportunity to be a part of this program to help them through that process. 
<br><br>

         Being both in a job and also volunteering I have learned a lot of professionalism from a lot of the adults who worked with me in these environments. It has taught me valuable skills that are very important for the workplace. Currently, I’m an undergraduate student working to get my degree in psychology with the plan of going to grad school after graduating. I’ve already gotten my high school degree. I’m hoping to use the skills I’ve attained with the amount of experience I have in order to apply it to the future workplaces that interests me. The ultimate goal is to do something in law with my current major.
